Use `python Labyrinth.py` to display the shortest path with directions from
the start to the end, and an array of coordinates that denote the shortest
path from the start to the rocket and finally to the end.

Make sure to overwrite the list[str] at the bottom of the Labyrinth.py file
to try out different mazes. It's currently using the maze provided in the
assignment.
